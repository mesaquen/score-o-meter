# Scoret-o-meter

A simple vanilla JS powered score counter with CSS3 animations.

## Live demo

You can access the live demo at [https://mesaquen.github.com/score-o-meter](https://mesaquen.github.com/score-o-meter)

## Notice

Right now, the counter only goes up to 12 and the match is finished. This is a deliberate behavior as it is intended to count points for the  "truco" brazilian card game.

The hability to customize the game rules will be added later in time.
