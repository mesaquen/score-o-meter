# Score-o-meter

A simple vanilla JS powered score counter with CSS3 animations.

## How to use

* Click on the player's side of screen to increase its score count.
* When max score is reached a button will appear to restart the match.

## Keyboard accessibility

* `LEFT ARROW` or  `RIGHT ARROW` to increase player's score.
* Hit `ENTER` to restart when button apears.

## Live demo

## Notice

Right now, the counter only goes up to 12 and the match is finished. This is a deliberate behavior as it is intended to count points for the  "truco" brazilian card game.

The hability to customize the game rules will be added later in time.
